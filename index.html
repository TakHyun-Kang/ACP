    <h3>Question: 1</h3>
    <p>
      Debbie Garza (dgj123) was recently hired by your company as an engineer to work on the TI-X Prototype space Engine. At the same time, your company has implemented new security requirements to protect intellectual property.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have set up new groups, space, and page restrictions for the teams in Space Home. You added Debbie to the engine-developers group; however, she still cannot see the TI-X Prototype space Engine page, even though you can view and edit that page. Using the Exhibits below, troubleshoot the problem.

    <h3>Question: 6</h3>
    <p>
      The VP of Engineering wants our internal engineers to work with two vendors, Allotek and Miradyne, on separate prototypes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current space permissions allow confluence-users (all users) to View and comment on all pages, while the Internal engineers group and groups representing external engineers (allotek- engineers and miradyne-engineers) are also able to edit all content in the space.
    </p>
    <img src="./200_img/스크린샷 2019-04-21 오전 11.57.43.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; margin-bottom: 50px;">
    <p>
      There are View restrictions in place that:<br/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A restrict viewing the Allotek page and its children to allotek-engineers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Restrict viewing the Miradyne page and its children to miradyne-engineers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow our engineers to view both pages and their children.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The VP has also stated that there will be shared components that both Allotek and Miradyne will need to have access to view and edit.<br/>
      How would you structure the pages and/or permissions to satisfy this requirement?
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Each vendor uses Excerpt macros on their pages whenever a shared component is documented. The other vendor uses Excerpt Include macros on their pages to render the data.<br/>
      B. Use the Contributors macro on the Engine Protoypes page and set the labels parameter to include shared components.<br/>
      C. Use a label (such as shared-component) on each page where shared components are discussed. Embed a Content by Label macro on the Engine prototype page.<br/>
      D. Add a child page to Engine Prototypes for Shared Components.

    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="padding-bottom: 100px; border-bottom: 1px solid;">
    <h3>Question: 8</h3>
    <p>
      A user has found a page in Confluence that he believes would be a good addition to a space he is building. The author of the page has asked him not to move the page, as it needs to stay where it is and the author needs to keep ownership of it.<br/>
      Which two methods would resolve this issue?
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Add the author to the user's space and move the page.<br/>
      B. Use the Include Page macro to display the page in the user's space.<br/>
      C. Use an internal link to refer to the page in the original space.<br/>
      D. Copy the page into the user's space.<br/>
      E. Create a User Macro for the content and use that in both spaces.

      The two existing Columns contain lots of Writing, tables, and images.<br/>
      What effect will the new column have on the layout of the existing columns?
    </p>
    <p>
      A. If the changes in width mean text has to be wrapped, tables moved, or a column lengthened, a warning message will appear.<br/>
      B. When new information is added to the new column, the three columns will span the width of the page in proportion to the amount of text in them.<br/>
      C. If a table in a column is now too wide for it, a horizontal scroll bar will appear to allow users to see more of it.<br/>
      D. Until the new column has text, the existing columns will stay their original widths.
    </p>

  <div style="padding-bottom: 100px; border-bottom: 1px solid;">
    <h3>Question: 10</h3>
    <p>
      Your organization uses both Confluence and JIRA and has decided to store all documentation in a single Confluence space. This is presenting search challenges, and people are struggling to find the pages they need.<br/>
      You have a lot of parent pages, each with numerous child pages, and neither a consistent naming scheme nor labels have been employed.<br/>
      Which approach should you take to address this situation?
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Use JIRA Query Language (JCL) to build search filters for Confluence pages.<br/>
      B. Install an add-on to enhance Confluence search.<br/>
      C. Place the Page Tree search macro on each parent page.<br/>
      D. Collect typical search terms and configure the search Results macro so it is restricted to the Page Tree.<br/>
      E. Place the Livesearch macro on the space home so people can see what results will be returned instantly.
